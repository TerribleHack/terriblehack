      <p>The first one! It was so haphazard that we booked a lecture hall that didn't have outlets in it, so we asked people to bring their own power bars and extension cords to get power from the front of the room. You can <a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/blog/terriblehack/">read about some of the hacks people made in this blog post.</a></p>


      <h2>October 2015: TerribleHack II</h2>
      <p>We tried to 3D print a trophy for this one. It turned out small and kind of not great. Fitting, I suppose?</p>

      <h2>March 2016: TerribleHack III</h2>

      </p>
      <p>I was on a co-op work term for this one so I can only relay what I've heard from others, but apparently this one managed to cater shawarma for the event. This solidified the foiunding organizers as the clear B team.</p>

      <h2>July 2016: TerribleHack IV: A New Joke</h2>
      <p>Buckle up, this is a wild one.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column expand">
          <p>To the right you'll see the list of "awards" we were going to give out. You may notice that one of them is sponsored by Zynga, the company responsible for Farmville and a bunch of other social games that are much less remembered. That's right, we gained enough notoriety that Zynga <em>reached out to us</em> and asked if <em>they</em> could give <em>us</em> money to be a part of the next TerribleHack!</p>
          <p>I like to think they knew they were going to be the butt of the joke a bit. They sent some developers to Waterloo for the event along with some leftover t-shirts from failed game projects to give out. They were nice guys; they even participated and made a dank game of their own.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img class="full" src="history/zynga.png" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This year we also made our own t-shirts to give to people, but designed in the most pure, democratic way: an open Facebook poll.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column expand">
          <img class="full" src="history/democracy.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img class="full" src="history/americas-next-top-model.png" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>To my extreme regret, the idea that won (by a landslide) was a meta-joke referencing a different option in the poll. Instead of having "frontend developer" on the front and "backend developer" on the back, why not switch it so it says back on the front and front on the back?</p>

      <p align="center">
        <img class="full" src="history/thereference.png" />
      </p>

      <p>So now we all had these shirts that were kind of funny at TerribleHack, required explanation everywhere else, and were not quite funny enough to justify the effort of that explanation. It really do be like that sometimes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="column expand">
          <p>We also had a robot wrestling contest, also sponsored by Zynga. Why? Because we had a bunch of leftover robot kits from an earlier, failed educational hackathon we tried to run and we wanted to make back some of the cost by selling people the kits.</p>
