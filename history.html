      <p>The first one! It was so haphazard that we booked a lecture hall that didn't have outlets in it, so we asked people to bring their own power bars and extension cords to get power from the front of the room.

      <h2>October 2015: Terriblehack II</h2>
      <p>We tried to 3D print a trophy for this one. It turned out small and kind of not great. Fitting, I suppose?</p>

      <p>I was on a co-op work term for this one so I can only relay what I've heard from others, but apparently this one managed to cater shawarma for the event. This solidified the foiunding organizers as the clear B team.</p>
