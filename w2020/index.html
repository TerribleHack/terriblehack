      <h2>What is TerribleHack?</h2>
      <p>Most hackathons are about coming up with innovative new ideas and making plausible startup prototypes. This one is different. This one is about making terrible hacks! <strong>Take some time to make your bad ideas a reality.</strong></p>

      <h2>Where is it?</h2>
      <p>For the first time ever, we will be running an <b>online hackathon</b> on Discord from <b>Saturday May 16 to Sunday May 17, 2020</b>. More information will be posted, but this event is open to all!</p>

      <h2>How it's going to work</h2>

        <div class="column expand">
          <p><strong>We start at 10am Pacific on Saturday.</strong> You'll have the weekend to work on a project. Chat on Discord with us as you go! <strong>Demos will be at 5pm Pacific on Sunday</strong>, where we'll join together for a video call to show our projects to each other. Can't make the call? Feel free to send a demo video as well, and we will all watch it together!</p>
          <p><a href="#signup">Sign up</a> regardless of whether you've got a team, you don't have one but want help finding one, you'd rather make something on your own, or even if you just want to spectate!</p>

      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <p>We started TerribleHack in 2015. We were young students at the University of Waterloo, eager to temporarily break away from the pressure and professionalism of traditional hackathons. We wanted some dedicated time to mix humour and technical savvy and to share the results with our friends. The result was the first TerribleHack, and in the past five years, the tradition has continued.</p>

      <p><a href="about.html">We are now University of Waterloo graduates, joined by current students and friends.</a> Now that time and space have no meaning, we're here to send you some much-needed levity over the wire with our first online TerribleHack!</p>

      <h2>Inspiration</h2>

      <h2>Help Out</h2>
      <p>Normally this is where we'd ask for some financial help to get food for the event. Since that's no longer a problem, we ask instead that, if you have the means, you <strong>send what you can to a charity</strong> that's helping out in this time of need. Here are some suggestions:</p>
      <p>Canada Helps has a comprehensive list of organizations <a href="https://www.canadahelps.org/en/donate-to-coronavirus-outbreak-response/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, consider donating to the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donors-and-partners/funding">WHO response fund</a>.</p>
      <p>This is completely optional, but if you do, show us a receipt on #contact-admins once we add you to our Discord! If you give us a photo, we'll send you back a <a href="about.html">doodle of you</a> or a customized VR version of you from our TerribleHack&copy; VR Experience&trade;!</p>
