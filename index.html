      <h2>What is TerribleHack?</h2>
      <p>Most hackathons are about coming up with innovative new ideas and making plausible startup prototypes. This one is different. This one is about making terrible hacks! <strong>Take some time to make your bad ideas a reality.</strong></p>

      <p>We have a long history of TerribleHack shenanigans, both in person and virtual!</p>
      <p align="center"><a class="button" href="history.html">Read about TerribleHack's history</a></p>

      <h2>Where is it?</h2>
      <p>This year, we will be running an <b>online hackathon</b> on Discord from <b>Friday April 22 to Sunday April 24, 2022</b>. More information will be posted, but this event is open to all!</p>

      <h2>How it's going to work</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column expand">
          <p><strong>We start in the evening on Friday.</strong> You'll have the weekend to work on a project. <strong>Demos will be on Sunday evening</strong>, where we'll join together for a video call to show our projects to each other. Can't make the call? Feel free to send a demo video as well, and we will all watch it together!</p>
          <p><a href="#signup">Sign up</a> regardless of whether you've got a team, you don't have one but want help finding one, you'd rather make something on your own, or even if you just want to spectate!</p>

      <p>Chat on Discord with us as you go! Invites will be circulated closer to the event. We'll also run small, optional events here and there, such as watching <em>The Room</em> (2003) together, or <a href="history.html#bobross">doing a virtual Bob Ross follow-along in mspaint.</a></p>

      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <p>We started TerribleHack in 2015. We were young students at the University of Waterloo, eager to temporarily break away from the pressure and professionalism of traditional hackathons. We wanted some dedicated time to mix humour and technical savvy and to share the results with our friends. The result was the first TerribleHack, and <a href="history.html" target="_blank">in the years since, the tradition has continued.</a></p>

      <p><a href="about.html">We are now University of Waterloo graduates.</a> Now that time and space have no meaning, we're here to send you some much-needed levity over the wire with another online TerribleHack!</p>
